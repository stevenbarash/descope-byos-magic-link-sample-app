# Descope's Bring Your Own Screen Sample App

Welcome to Descope's Bring Your Own Screen Sample App, a demonstration of how to integrate Descope flows with custom screens within a Next.JS application.

## Descope Bring Your Own Screen

This project demonstrates Descope's "Bring Your Own Screen" feature, which allows developers to:
- Customize the entire authentication UI while leveraging Descope flows and session management
- Maintain full control over the user experience and design
- Integrate authentication flows seamlessly into existing applications
- Use pre-built components or create custom ones
- Handle authentication states and transitions with ease

The implementation includes:
- A "Welcome Screen" that prompts the user for their email address.
- A "Verify OTP" screen that prompts the user for an OTP sent to their email.
- A "User Information" screen that prompts new user's to enter their full name.
